# Objective-C data type and operators

***

1. simple data type

 * int: 4 byte commonly , `NSLog("%i",intTypeName)` ï¼Œthe first bit stands for signs
 	 - short int/short: 2 byte ,just to save the space
 	 - long int/long: 4 byte  commonly
 	 - unsigned: can not express minus, 1 express minus ,0 express positive numbers
 	 	 - unsigned short
 	 	 - unsigned int 
 	 	 - unsigned long 

  > Note: 
  	 the below int type was based in decimal system, but the int type has other two format, octonary system is like this `int oct = 010;NSLog(@"the octonary number is %0 ",oct)`; and hex system just like this `int hex = 0Xae;NSLog(@"the hex number is %0x",hex)`

 * real type: 4 bytes,save it as exponent format, in fact the real type data exist round-off errors
 	 - constant
 	 	 - decimal fraction: 0.0, -1.4 , 3.4, 300. ,2.30 etc, `NSLog(@"the decimal fraction could be express like this %f")`
 	 	 - exponent: 2.1E5, -1,2e-2, 0.4e-2, `NSLog(@"the exponent type could be express as this %e",)`
 	 - variable
 	 	 - float: (32bit),7 bit valid numbers 
 	 	 - double: (64bit), 16 bit valid numbers
 	 	 - long double: (16byte,128bit)
